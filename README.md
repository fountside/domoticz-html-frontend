# domoticz-html-frontend
An interface in HTML bringing together any Domoticz switches or sensors, Hue lights and Sonos speakers.  Example templates for each zone of the home: lights, devices, climate, audio, security.
Each htm file has a list of variables at the start which will need to be updated to your specific circumstances - such as your Domoticz password and user name, as well as the IP address of your Domoticz Server.  More information on using these templates is available on YouTube - search for Fabulous Home Automation.
